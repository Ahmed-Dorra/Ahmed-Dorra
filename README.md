#  **Who am I ?**
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ahmed Abo Dorra, studied Mechatronics Engineering at Mansoura University.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Embedded Software development and IOT.

## I have done projects using AVR MIcrocontroller like :
 ### 1. Stop-Watch :
-  Developed a system that controls the stop-watch time and displays it on 7-segments.
-   Drivers: GPIO, Timer, External Interrupts, and 7-Segment.
-    controller used: ATmega32 Microcontroller
    
 ### 2. Fan Speed Controller based on Temperature: :
-  Developed a system that controls the speed of a fan depending on the temperature.
-  Drivers: GPIO, ADC, PWM, LM35, LCD, and DC-Motor.
-   controller used: ATmega32 Microcontroller.

 ### 3. Distance Measuring System :
-  Developed a system that measures the distance and displays it on LCD.
-  Drivers: GPIO, ICU, Ultrasonic Sensor, and LCD.
-  controller used: ATmega32 Microcontroller.

 ### 4. Door Locker Security System :
- Developed a system to unlock a door using a password.
-  Drivers: GPIO, Keypad, LCD, Timer, UART, I2C, EEPROM, Buzzer, and DC-Motor.
-    controller used: ATmega32 Microcontroller

 ## I have also worked on other projects utilizing other controllers like:
 ### 1.  Robotic arm
- hardware and software development as well as assembling parts.
-  controller used: Arduino
  
  ### 2. 3D scanner
 - Assembled the parts, did the hardware connections and developed the code used to drive the project 
 - controller used: ESP32
 
  ### 3.	Self-balancing robot
- Contributed in the development of code used.
-   controller used: Arduino
 
  ### 4.  River trash collector robot.
-  Contributed in the development of object detection needed to detect trash.
-    controller used: ESP32
